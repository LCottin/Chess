# Chess

This repository is the source code of a project done in pairs during our second year at ENSEIRB-MATMECA engineering school. 
The purpose of this project is to create a chess game using C++ language and SFML library. 

To compile the project, just write "make" in a terminal and launch the executable with "./main".
